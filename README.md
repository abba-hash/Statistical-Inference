Statistical Inference for Dynamics on Complex Networks.

This repository contains the code and data for my thesis on "Statistical Inference for Dynamics on Complex Networks." The thesis explores methodologies for understanding and analyzing dynamic processes on complex network structures using statistical inference techniques.

Introduction
The study of dynamics on complex networks has significant implications across various fields such as epidemiology, sociology, and engineering. This thesis presents statistical inference methods to analyze and predict the behavior of such dynamic processes. The methodologies implemented are demonstrated through SIR model.
